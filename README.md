# 🎬 Pandas Movie Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains **two hands-on Pandas projects** focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using real-world movie datasets. These projects demonstrate strong fundamentals in **data wrangling, aggregation, filtering, and insight generation using Python (Pandas)** — skills essential for Data Analyst roles.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Project 1: Movie Titles & Cast Analysis (Foundational Pandas)

**Notebook:** `Exercises-1_PANDAS.ipynb`

#### 🔍 Objective

To explore a movie **cast dataset** and answer analytical questions using core Pandas operations such as filtering, sorting, grouping, indexing, and aggregation.

#### 📊 Dataset Used

* **cast.csv**
* Key columns include:

  * `title`
  * `year`
  * `character`

#### 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated

* Reading CSV files using Pandas
* Data inspection (`head`, `dtypes`)
* Filtering rows using conditions
* Sorting and deduplication
* Indexing and performance optimization
* Aggregation using `groupby`

#### 📌 Business / Analytical Questions Answered

* Total number of unique movies
* Earliest movies ever released
* Frequency analysis of popular movie titles (e.g., *Hamlet*)
* Timeline analysis of movies across years
* Year-based production trends

#### 💡 Key Insights

* Certain movie titles (like *Hamlet*) have been remade multiple times across decades
* Indexing significantly improves query performance on large datasets
* Early cinema production trends can be identified using simple Pandas operations

### 2️⃣ Project 2: Advanced Movie Trend Analysis (Decade-Level Insights)

**Notebook:** `Exercises-2_Pandas.ipynb`

#### 🔍 Objective

To perform **time-based trend analysis** on movie data and extract insights at a **decade level**, simulating real-world analytical reporting.

#### 📊 Datasets Used

* **titles.csv** (movie metadata)
* **cast.csv** (movie cast information)

#### 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated

* Value frequency analysis
* Decade-based feature engineering
* Grouping and aggregation
* Analytical thinking for trend detection
* Preparing data for visualization

#### 📌 Business / Analytical Questions Answered

* Most common movie titles of all time
* Peak movie production years during the 1930s
* Number of films released per decade
* Character-level trend analysis (e.g., *Hamlet*, *Rustler*)

#### 💡 Key Insights

* Movie production increased significantly post-1950s
* Some characters and titles persist across multiple generations
* Decade-level aggregation is powerful for long-term trend analysis
